        So far in the 2024 Formula One season we have seen 7 drivers and 4 teams win a grand prix giving much
        uncertainty going into the summer break. The paddock is tighter than it has ever been with sometimes less than
        a second separating the pack in qualifying. With 10 races to go this season is anything but predictable from now
        to the checkered flag in Abu Dhabi.

      <h2>Wrapping Up the 2024 Season</h2>
      <p>
       With 10 races to go we can now wait for an amazing championship battle. With Red Bull, McLaren, Ferrari and 
       even Mercedes in contention for the championship we have a lot to look forward to. The other team are also
       scraping for the final point positions and avoid becoming last in the standings. The 2024 season has been 
       action filled so far and with more to come.
