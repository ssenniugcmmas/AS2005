    Throughout the 2024 season we have seen 4 teams take a win across the grid. This has really brought this 
    season to life with a real fight up front and regular different winners. These teams are Redbull, Ferrari,
    Mercedes and McLaren. With 10 races to go this championship could be anyones.

      RedBull Racing
    </h2>
    <p>
      Redbull have been the champions for the last couple of year with Max Verstappen
      winning 3 championships in a row. This year they got to an amazing start and got back to back 1-2 finishes.
      It looked to be another year of RedBull dominance until the McLaren updates in Miami. From that point onwards
      Redbull have seen to be on the wrong foot and expecially Sergio Perez. With Perez's long run of bad form McLaren
      and Ferrari have been closing in on Redbull and will probably overtake them. After the Belgium Grand Prix
      McLaren are now only 40 points behind Redbull and closing.

    <h2>Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team</h2>
    <p>Mercedes have been seeking to return to form after a fall off in the 2022 season. Lewis Hamilton, 
    right at the start of the season had signed for Ferrari leaving Mercedes needed to find a driver
    to replace him for the next season. At the start they were the 4th fastest car and around 150 points
    McLaren, Ferrari and RedBull. However, things started to turn around after claiming a pole position in Canada
    and a podium there aswell. Then things really turned around when they won 3 races in the space of 4 Grand Prix's.
    There objective for the rest of the season is to out preform McLaren and Ferrari to try catch up with the rest.

    <h2>Scuderia Ferrari</h2>
    <p>Ferrari started the season with the second fastest car and a race win in the third race in Australia. Earlier 
      in the season they had poached the 7 time world champion Lewis Hamilton from Mercedes which meant they have to 
      let go of Carlos Sainz at the end of the season. This season both Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc have gained a 
      race win each at Australia and Monaco. Since Monaco though they have been struggling and have lost second place in
      the championship to McLaren. They have now seem to be the fourth fastest on the grid and are struggling to finish 
      on the podium. Their goal for the rest of the year is to recover their pace and outscore McLaren and RedBull to finish
      in first for the constructors championship.

    <h2>McLaren</h2>
    <p>McLaren seem to be the most promising team this season with their amazing car development.
      They did have a slow start to the season with being placed in 4th after the first two races but 
      after that they looked to be one of the fastest on track. In Miami they were able to score their 
      first race win this season with their B-Spec car. This car was now by far the fastest car on the grid
      but Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri still needed to preform. Podiums were now a regular for them with
      them getting a podium at every race since China but they need more wins. McLarens aim for the rest of the
      season is to win as much as possible to cemment both championships by the end of the season.
