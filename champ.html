    <h2>
      RedBull Racing
    </h2>
    <p>
      Redbull have been the champions for the last couple of year with Max Verstappen
      winning 3 championships in a row. This year they got to an amazing start and got back to back 1-2 finishes.
      It looked to be another year of RedBull dominance until the McLaren updates in Miami. From that point onwards
      Redbull have seen to be on the wrong foot and expecially Sergio Perez. With Perez's long run of bad form McLaren
      and Ferrari have been closing in on Redbull and will probably overtake them. After the Belgium Grand Prix
      McLaren are now only 40 points behind Redbull and closing.

    <h2>Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team</h2>
    <p>Mercedes have been seeking to return to form after a fall off in the 2022 season. Lewis Hamilton, 
    right at the start of the season had signed for Ferrari leaving Mercedes needed to find a driver
    to replace him for the next season. At the start they were the 4th fastest car and around 150 points
    McLaren, Ferrari and RedBull. However, things started to turn around after claiming a pole position in Canada
    and a podium there aswell. Then things really turned around when they won 3 races in the space of 4 Grand Prix's.
    There objective for the rest of the season is to out preform McLaren and Ferrari to try catch up with the rest.

    <h2>Scuderia Ferrari</h2>
    <p>Ferrari started the season with the second fastest car and a race win in the third race in Australia. Earlier 
      in the season they had poached the 7 time world champion Lewis Hamilton from Mercedes which meant they have to 
      let go of Carlos Sainz at the end of the season. This season both Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc have gained a 
      race win each at Australia and Monaco. Since Monaco though they have been struggling and have lost second place in
      the championship to McLaren.
