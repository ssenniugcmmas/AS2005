    <p>At the back the teams are very close and sometimes are moving up to the mid field. The F1 teams Alpine, 
        Williams and Kick Sauber F1 are having an almighty fight for the slightest chance of points. In the future 
        races we will be hoping to see more of them move from the back to the mid field to a higher chance of point.

  <section class="content-section aston-content">
    <p>Alpine have had a recent trend of a decreacing performance. In 2022 we saw them all the way up in 4th place.
        In 2023 they then fell to 6th place and this year they are only 8th now. At this rate, next year they should 
        realistically be in 10th or more known as last. This year they have already anounsed that Estaban Ocon will be 
        leaving them along with young Jack Dohaan joining them. This then leaves them with a new driver to work with and 
        try help bring up the order.

    <p>Williams are one of the most successful formula one teams ever and have been trying to return to old form
        in resent years. They have a young line up with Alex Albon and Logan Sargent who are both able to score points
        with the car given. However points haven't came easy so far with Alex only scoring 4 so far and Logan with none. 
        Their focus is to now look at the high speed tracks were they will have an advantage and find some rouge points 
        to pick up.

    <p>Kick Sauber F1 team have been pointless so far this season. Having signed Nico Hulkenburg from Haas earlier
        this season they now want to please their new incoming driver. Another thing they want to please is their 
        new owners of Audi who will take over the team in the 2026 F1 season. With the support of a major car manufacture
        they can now start making moves forwards to the points and maybe even more.
