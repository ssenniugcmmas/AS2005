  <section class="content-section intro-content">
    <p>This year the Midfield is tight with many teams in contention for points. We have Aston Martin who are seeking
      to return to the podium but have fallen right down to competting with VCARB and Haas. VCARB who were Alpha Tauri
      last year are aiming to bring up more junior drivers up into the big Red Bull team. Their goal is to try finish
      ahead of Aston Martin in 5th. Haas on the other hand is to keep themselves in the Top 7 and find ways to make
      thier way up the order. </p>

  <section class="content-section aston-content">
    <p>Last year Aston Martin were up with the top 5 teams and scoring podiums at 8 races. However since mid season
      last year they have gone backwards. They are very inconsistent with thier points at the moment with Haas outscoring
      them in the last few races. With Fernando Alonso signed to 2026 and Honda becoming their engine supplier in 2026
      they now need to look to the future to try recover their pace.

  <section class="content-section visa-content">
    <p>Visa Cash App Racing Bulls or VCARB for short were Alpha Tauri last year were one of the slower cars but unlike
      Aston Martin they improved their pace after the mid season break in 2023. This year they have scored a good amount
      of points compared to last year with Yuki scoring 22 points and Daniel Riccardo scoring 12 points. Their goal for
      the rest of the season is to try catch up and pass Aston Martin in the championship.

  <section class="content-section haas-content">
    <p>Haas is the newest team in Formula One joining in 2016. For their entier time in this sport they have
      either been fighting in the mid field or and the back of the pack. With both of their drivers leaving at the
      end of the year they want to make good impressions for the new drivers coming in. So far they have done this
      by having so far the 5th highest point haul from the European leg. Their goal is to consistantly be fighting
      for points and avoid falling to the back of the grid.
