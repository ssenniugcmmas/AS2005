    <p>This year the Midfield is tight with many teams in contention for points. We have Aston Martin who are seeking
      to return to the podium but have fallen right down to competting with VCARB and Haas. VCARB who were Alpha Tauri
      last year are aiming to bring up more junior drivers up into the big Red Bull team. Their goal is to try finish

      thier way up the order. </p>
