        <p>
          So far in the 2024 Formula One season we have seen 7 drivers and 4 teams win a grand prix giving much 
          uncertainty going into the summer break. The paddock is tighter than it has ever been with sometimes less than
          a second seperating the pack in qualifying. With 10 races to go this season is anything but predictable from now
          to the checkered flag in Abu Dhabi.
