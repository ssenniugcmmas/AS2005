    <section> The 2024 Formula 1 season has been anything but predictable, with several teams and drivers making headlines. Red Bull continues to lead both the Drivers’ and Constructors’ Championships, thanks to Max Verstappen’s consistent performances. Verstappen’s dominance has been a key factor, but the team has faced challenges, including internal investigations and the departure of key personnel1.

      McLaren has emerged as a formidable competitor, significantly closing the gap to Red Bull. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have both secured race wins, making McLaren a strong contender for the Constructors’ Championship.
      
      Their impressive turnaround from a slow start has been one of the season’s biggest surprises.

      
      Ferrari, while not as dominant as Red Bull or McLaren, has shown improvement compared to last year. They remain in the hunt for the Constructors’ Championship, sitting just 42 points behind Red Bull.
      
      Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz have both delivered solid performances, keeping Ferrari in contention.


      
      Mercedes has also made strides, with Lewis Hamilton and George Russell consistently scoring points. However, they have struggled to match the pace of Red Bull and McLaren on a regular basis. 

      

      Sergio Perez’s form has been a concern for Red Bull, with a significant dip in performance during the European leg of the season3. This has put additional pressure on Verstappen to maintain the team’s lead in both championships.
      
      Overall, the 2024 season has been a mix of expected dominance and surprising developments. With 10 races remaining, the battle for both championships is far from over, promising an exciting second half of the season for F1 fans.
